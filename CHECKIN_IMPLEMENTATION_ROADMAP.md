---

## 📝 Phase 3: Text Analysis

### 3.1 Text Analyzer

- Keywords/themes
- Positive drivers
- Negative drivers
- 16 linguistic features (for fusion)

**Implementation:**

- AWS Comprehend for sentiment
- Custom keyword extraction

- Linguistic feature extraction

---

### 3.2 Risk Assessor

**File:** `analyzers/riskAssessor.ts`

**Outputs:**

- Risk level (none/mild/moderate/high)
- Risk reasons (specific concerns)

**Triggers:**

- Explicit harm mentions
- Persistent negative affect (multimodal + text)
- Extreme changes vs baseline
- Linguistic markers (absolutism, negation)

---

## 🧮 Phase 4: Fusion & Scoring

### 4.1 Fusion Engine

**File:** `fusion/fusionEngine.ts`

**Algorithm:**

1. Compute z-scores vs personal baseline
2. Quality-weight each modality
3. Fuse into single deviation score
4. Convert to Mind Measure score (0-100)
5. Determine direction of change

**Inputs:**

- Audio score + confidence
- Visual score + confidence
- Text score + confidence
- User baseline data

**Outputs:**

- mindMeasureScore (0-100)
- directionOfChange (better/same/worse)
- uncertainty
- contributing factors

---

### 4.2 Baseline Comparator

**File:** `fusion/baselineComparator.ts`

**Responsibilities:**

- Load user baseline from database
- Compute z-scores for each feature
- Identify significant deviations
- Update baseline (adaptive learning)

---

## 📦 Phase 5: Assembly & Integration

### 5.1 Dashboard Assembler

**File:** `assembly/dashboardAssembler.ts`

**Responsibilities:**

- Combine fusion result + text analysis
- Format for UI display
- Structure for database storage
- Generate user notifications

---

### 5.2 Component Integration

**File:** Update existing `CheckinAssessment.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Call check-in enrichment service
- Show processing screen
- Display multimodal results
- Handle errors gracefully

---

## 🧪 Phase 6: Testing & Calibration

### 6.1 Unit Tests

- Test each extractor independently
- Test fusion algorithm with known inputs
- Test text analyzer with sample transcripts

### 6.2 Integration Tests

- End-to-end check-in flow
- With/without baseline comparison
- Graceful degradation scenarios

### 6.3 Calibration

- Run on real conversational data
- Adjust feature ranges
- Tune fusion weights
- Validate against PHQ-9/GAD-7

## 🤖 Institutional Agent Resolution

**CheckinAssessmentSDK** resolves the institution-specific ElevenLabs agent before starting a session.

**Flow:**

- Calls `GET /api/agents/resolve?university_id=...` to obtain the institutional agent ID
- Falls back to the default **Jodie Check-in** agent (`agent_7501k3hpgd5gf8ssm3c3530jx8qx`) if no institutional agent is configured
- The `/api/agents/resolve` endpoint is hosted on the mobile app's own backend, querying the shared database
